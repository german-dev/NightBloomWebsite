                            Honey, where is your greatest pain and pleasure in your body? <br> <br>
                            It all comes down to the pelvis: the seat of fertility, creativity, pleasure, and, unfortunately, many generations of wounding. 
                            Have you ever been with a yoga or meditation teacher who treats your entire body, tip to tail, without mentioning your genitals? 
                            They invite attention to every finger, toe, pore on your skin, and hair on your scalp, but there’s this big no-go zone in the pelvis where our culture is too scared to look. <br> <br>
                            There is NOTHING bad or wrong about your beautiful body. Especially not your genitals. 
                            But it is easy to grow up thinking your genitals are bad, dirty, or wrong. That’s a real shame.<br> <br>                            
                            Sexuality is central, not peripheral, to healing wounds of femininity, fertility, intimacy, and motherhood. Sexual energy is life-force energy. 
                            When you feel turned on in your body, you feel turned on to life. So when you come to see me, you are welcome to bring sexual goals for holistic thriving.
                            
                        </p>
                        
            <h3 class="my-6 text-2xl md:text-3xl font-light font-serif text-center md:text-left ">Learn about what makes your body tick.</h3>

                            Sometimes, working on your sexuality can feel very out of reach. 
                            In any woman’s lifetime, there are so many seasons and cycles that everything changes, 
                            again and again, just when you thought you had your dear body figured out. <br> <br>
                            When I had my first child and was trying to breastfeed, my vaginal tissue would tear with the slightest pressure. I couldn’t ride a bicycle, and sex was off the table.
                            If I, a scientist who used to teach sex-ed, didn’t know how much my hormones would affect my pelvic tone, which could be expected to know her body? <br> <br>
                            We’re each left to stumble through this minefield alone. The poor gynecologists receive the outpouring of our ignorance as they care for our physical health. 
                            Unfortunately, they don’t have all the tools for supporting sexual dysfunction and low libido in women when it isn’t an illness at play. 
                            Hormone replacement therapy is about the best on offer, and not everyone wants to be supplementing hormones for decades of her life.<br> <br>
                            Our sexuality is particularly sensitive to the impacts of stress on the body. If you’re in burnout, sex is likely the least appealing thing you want to consider. 
                            Inflammation and physical tension can cause a lot of pain and anguish in the body, particularly around sex. 
                            That’s why I’ve supplemented my VITA coaching education with a Flourish Pelvic Health Coaching certification.

                            Women have many goals when working with me; not all bring goals of sexual thriving. But it would be an oversight for me to ignore coaching on sexuality. 
                            Sexuality is central to, not incidental to, human thriving; if you need help with your sex life, I am here for it. <br> <br>
                            When I quit my job as a math and science teacher to work on grief full time, I specifically sought a coaching certification that centers on sexuality and relationship. 
                            I know from a decade of bereavement support that the wounds of grief extend into the body and marriage and that there are massive casualties in the arena of sexuality and pleasure. <br> <br> 
                            Couples are also welcome to work on goals of sexual thriving. 
                            I am particularly passionate about helping couples overcome long, dry spells to discover even better sex than they had in their youth. 
                            We can honor the seasons of marriage and the seasons of the body while continuing to expand into deeper intimacy and greater pleasure. 
                            Sexuality will change as we change; it can improve if we learn from our bodies. 
                            There’s no expiration date on satisfaction. <br> <br>
                            My purpose is to shine light in dark places and break open taboos. 
                            You deserve to feel good in your body – your whole body – whether in a moment of intimacy with a partner or just walking down the street enjoying a beautiful day. <br> <br>
